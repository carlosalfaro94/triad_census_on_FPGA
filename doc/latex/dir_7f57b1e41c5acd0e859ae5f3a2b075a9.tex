\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
file \hyperlink{BF__header_8h}{B\+F\+\_\+header.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the functions needed to execute the Brute Force kernels. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{defs_8h}{defs.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the structures that are used for the kernel code. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{edge_8h}{edge.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the functions needed to create and manage an edge of a graph.  within project, we consider only directed graphs; edges must have a direction. ~\newline
In our implementation, edge information is saved twice, since each of the nodes keeps its adjacency list (see \hyperlink{node_8h}{node.\+h}).~\newline
 Each edge structure is therefore part of the node it belongs to, and contains the id of the other neigbhbor, and the direction.~\newline
 The direction is coded using the 2 less significant bits of the uint32\+\_\+t used for storing the edge.~\newline
 \textquotesingle{}01\textquotesingle{} means that the edge goes out from the node it belongs, \textquotesingle{}10\textquotesingle{} means edge goes in, and \textquotesingle{}11\textquotesingle{} conveys bidirectionality. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{graph_8h}{graph.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the functions needed to create and manage a graph. ~\newline
In our implementation, the graph is read from a file which, in each of its lines, contains an edge of the graph in this format\+:~\newline
 src\+\_\+node\+\_\+id tgt\+\_\+node\+\_\+id ~\newline
In the structure, nodes can be ordered by ascending order of their ids. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{NDRange__BM__header_8h}{N\+D\+Range\+\_\+\+B\+M\+\_\+header.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the functions needed to execute the N\+D\+Range BM kernels. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{node_8h}{node.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the functions ~\newline
needed to create and manage a node of a graph. ~\newline
In our implementation, the graph is basically a list of nodes ~\newline
which are identified uniquely with and unsigned integer. Each ~\newline
node keeps track of its adjacency list, bi means of an array of ~\newline
edges. Since each edge connects two nodes, edge information will ~\newline
be duplicated. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{single__BM__header_8h}{single\+\_\+\+B\+M\+\_\+header.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the definitions of the functions needed to execute the single BM kernels. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{utils_8h}{utils.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains the enumerations and macros needed for the whole project. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
